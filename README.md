## Overview
The folder contains 4 standalone scripts. NB.py contains our own implementation of Naive Bayes and KNN_from_scratch.py contains our own implementation of KNN. NaiveBayes.py and KNN.py exercise sklearn functions for making predictions.

To run prediction, download the folder and open one of the scripts. Each script runs on its own. Both NB.py and KNN_from_scratch.py will output a csv with predictions for the test file.
